# Prediction-Coherent LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network

This repository contains the source code of the "Prediction-Coherent LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network for Safer Glucose Predictions in Diabetes", by M. DE BOIS et al., accepted to the ICONIP 2019 conference.

In particular, the PyTorch implementation of the pcLSTM architecture and the cMSE loss function can be found in:
* pcLSTM: models/pcLSTM.py
* cMSE: tools/pytorch/loss_functions.py
